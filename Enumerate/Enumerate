Enumerate
Question one: Give the solution space,Build a simple mathematical model(First construct a collection of possible solution.)
What is the possible situation? The number of variables in the model is as small as possible, and they are independent of each other.
Question two: Reduce search space.
Use knowledge to narrow the value model of each variable in the model to avoid unnecessary calculations.
Question three: Use the appropriate search order.
The traversal order of the search space is consistent with the conditional expression in the model.
